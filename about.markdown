Howdy. I'm a Software Engineer by trade currently located in Boston, MA.
Feel free to hit me up if you want to talk about API design, building simple interfaces for complex business spaces, or anything tech as long as it's not obsessing over LLMs.

Outside of work, I enjoy tennis, cryptic crosswords, reading broadly, gastronomy, and all kinds of water activities. 


You can reach me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sabareesh-iyer) to talk about work or [Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8287122-sabareesh) to talk about books.
